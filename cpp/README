Build instructions:

$ cd yaml-cpp
$ git submodule init 
$ git submodule update 
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake .. 

If you need to specify a compiler, please do the following instead of the above cmake command:

$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=compiler_name

Then continue:

$ make
$ cd ../..
$ make

You'll also need to install and link Intel's MKL library. 

You can now run the code as 

$ ./qpesim [folder in /qsharp-verify/broombridge to use] [precision] [number of steps]

And pipe the output to a file.

Key files:

* main.cc - Has the main to show start of execution. 
* hamiltonian.hpp/cc - Implements the Hamiltonian interface.
* state_vector.hpp - Implements the StateVector data format
* time_evolution_over_terms.hpp - Implements the update process for the StateVector
